# This package gets installed in the native and foreign arch chroots.
# It creates files like /usr/lib/arch-bin-masquerade/armhf/gcc, which
# point in the native chroot to the armhf-cross-compiler, and in the
# armhf chroot to /usr/bin/gcc. That way compilation works fine, even
# when distcc gets the absolute path to the compiler passed (ccache does
# that).
