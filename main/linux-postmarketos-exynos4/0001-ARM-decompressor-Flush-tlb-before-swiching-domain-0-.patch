Subject: [PATCH 01/10] ARM: decompressor: Flush tlb before swiching domain 0
 to client mode
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

If the bootloader used a page table that is incompatible with domain 0
in client mode, and boots with the mmu on, then swithing domain 0 to
client mode causes a fault if we don't flush the tlb after updating
the page table pointer.

v2: Add ISB before loading dacr.
