Subject: [PATCH 02/10] ARM: dts: exynos: Add reboot modes to midas

The values have been taken from the sec-reboot.c driver in
the 3.0.101 smdk4412 kernel used in LineageOS which is based
on Samsung source code releases for various devices.

Only the strict minimum modes have been added: the S-Boot 4.0
bootloader is nonfree, so exporting less well known modes could
potentially have unwanted consequences.

TODO:
- After reboot to download, heimdall doesn't work while it works
  with the SMDK4412 kernel.
- Fix reboot without arguments (Test: Try "Reboot system now"
  in a recovery after rebooting to the recovery)
