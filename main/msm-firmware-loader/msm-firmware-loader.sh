# This script is responsible for loading firmware blobs from firmware
# partitions on qcom devices. It will make a dir in tmp, mount all of the
# interesting partitions there and then symlink blobs to a single dir that can
# be then provided to the kernel. (At this time only single additional
# directory can be provided)
#
# This script attempts to load everything at runtime and be as generic
# as possible between the target devices: It should allow a single rootfs
# to be used on multiple different devices as long as all the blobs
# are present on dedicated partitions.
# (Usually the case, Samsung devices ship all blobs, other devices may miss
# venus but that still allows for WiFi and modem to work)

# Configurations:

# List of partitions to be mounted and inspected for blobs.

# uses tmpfs to work around the early-run limitations as well as to reduce
# disk wear slightly.
